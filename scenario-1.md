# Scenario 1: Project Set up & Initial Deployment

## Summary

Your goal is to successfully launch a new Lucidity Azure DevOps project using supplied tools and to deploy the included canonical application to Azure.

**Notes:**

The application Docker Image is already on DockerHub and is configured in the canonical application environment variables.

A Lucidity Dev Container configuration is provided to speed up local environment set up and itâ€™s recommended it to utilize it in a code space or through VS Code

## Success Criteria

* A new Azure DevOps Project should be created.
* The canonical application (EShop on web) and its corresponding database should be deployed via pipelines to the dev environment.
